Working in EDI as a Boomi Administrator and Developer, I have not had too much need for coding languages outside of the occasional JavaScript for decision making and building Macros within Excel. Having been hounded by Recruiters for the last year and a half, I have learned that while I am fully capable of doing my current job, similar positions outside of the Boomi Platform in EDI all require SQL and a few other skills that I do not currently have. And while I currently have no plans of changing jobs, it does seem pertinent to my career to better myself for the future.

## âš¡ Fun fact: ...

This year is about working on me. Coding is how I am working out my mind. I have joined a gym where I work out 3 days a week in addition to Road Unicycling twice a week. My goal is to ride the 33 mile Square to Square event in May, and I'm currently up to 21.5 miles.
